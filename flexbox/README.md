# Flex Layout Sidebar Project

This project demonstrates a **responsive Flexbox layout** with a vertical sidebar and a main content area.  
The layout automatically adapts on smaller screens using media queries.

## 📁 Project Structure

## 🎯 Features

- Sidebar navigation with interactive hover effect
- Main content styled with colored background
- Responsive behavior: sidebar hidden on smaller screens (≤768px)
- Clean layout using `display: flex` and `flex-direction: column` on mobile

## 💡 What I Learned

- Building horizontal layout using Flexbox
- Customizing sidebar styles and transitions
- Applying media queries to hide/show layout parts responsively

## 🧪 How it works

- `display: flex` on the `.container` to place sidebar and content side-by-side
- `flex: 1` on `.main-content` to make it take up remaining space
- `@media (max-width: 768px)` changes layout to vertical and hides the sidebar

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- HTML5
- CSS3 (Flexbox, Media Queries)
